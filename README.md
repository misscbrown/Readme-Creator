# Readme-Creator
Creates and writes to readme file
Description:
This is a project that generates a READme file dynamically. It was created using Node JS and Javascript. Inquirer creates the dependencies required to run the project. For each project, a developer needs to generate an easy to read and understandable READme file, that potential collaborators or users can refer to. 

Here are some links for reference:

This project allows the user to dynamically create a readme file, by answering prompted questions directly in the terminal. The user can put as much information as needed, about the project, along with their contact details. They are also able to select the correct license badge for their project.

Installation
To install this READme generator, run npm init into the terminal, followed by npm inquirer. Once the project is run using node index.js, the prompted questions will be displayed in the terminal.


Usage
It is used by first installing, then answering the prompted questions. Once this is done, the READme file will be generated - the READme file can be updated as needed, by running node index.js again, to restart the prompts.


Contributing
This is a solo project so there are no contributors - however, I am in a homework group with Farhiya and Rizwan and we regularly share ideas, code and support each other with work.


Tests
To test this project, follow the instruction in the how is the project used section. If there are any errors, it will throw an err. However - at the time of writing, this works fine!

Future developments:
I'd consider building a READme generator targeted towards different industries - for example, I am interested in Music Tech primarily - so a specific READme file for devs in this industry, could look a lot different to this one. I think that would be interesting to explore.
